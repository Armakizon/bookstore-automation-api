## Stuff to change: 

1. API tests shouldn't have been made based on expected user behavior but should be based on the endpoints
2. Should have made less overlapping scenarios during the test design, alot of functions are getting checked multiple times by different tests
3. Choose a project that require less documentation relative to the amount of coding. 

## Stuff to keep:

1. Sectioning the work for each work session help tremendously with productivity.
